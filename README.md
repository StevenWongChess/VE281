I was `teaching assistant` of `VE281 Data Structure & Algorithm` with 2 other TAs `Zhenhao Gu` and `Chenchao Lin` Fall 2020.

##### Our responsibility & job:

1. `Grader`: grade homework & exam paper

2. Write test cases for coding project and run `JOJ(online judgement)` for grading
3. Set up a linux project environment using `bash`/`python` scripts
4. Hold office hour & answer questions on Piazza

##### Four Projects with C++11 new features:

###### Project1: 

​	Implement `bubble sort`, `insertion sort`, `selection sort`, `merge sort`, `quick sort` and apply them into `Graham’s Scan Algorithm`

###### Project2:

​	Implement a STL-like `hash table` data structure 

###### Project3:

​	Implement a STL-like K-D Tree (K-Dimensional Tree) data structure

###### Project4:

​	Implement a graph data structure using the adjacency list representation, and then implement some graph algorithms based on the data structure:

​	• Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm

​	• Topological sort

​	• Prim’s algorithm or Kruskal’s algorithm
